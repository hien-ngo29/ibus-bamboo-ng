IBus Bamboo NG is a fork of [IBus Bamboo](https://github.com/BambooEngine/ibus-bamboo), created to be the next generation of IBus Bamboo, with new features and some critical bug fixes, since IBus Bamboo has become silent and nobody maintains it.

## Notes
There haven't been any releases yet. Please take your time and wait while I figure things out. Or, building from source following this [building instruction](https://github.com/hien-ngo29/ibus-bamboo/wiki/H%C6%B0%E1%BB%9Bng-d%E1%BA%ABn-c%C3%A0i-%C4%91%E1%BA%B7t-t%E1%BB%AB-m%C3%A3-ngu%E1%BB%93n) (yeah sorry I don't have time to write the English version 4u)

### Special Thanks to the great people who made this project possible!
